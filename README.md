# shooting
   This like space-inaveders game. To create it we used pygame, mixer, random and time libraries. This game was created to final INTRO exam. 
   To move ship you have to click "right" and "left arrow", to shot you have to click "space". it is a infinity shot game in this game you don't have any levels. The game automaticly become more dificult(it is depends on time): 
     1.quantity of enenies increase 
     2.enemies start shot faster
     3.enemies will move faster
